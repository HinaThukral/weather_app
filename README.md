# weather_app
In this project,I used one url to convert http to https because when I use only http it did not respond.
So I just seearched on google why the api doesnot respond they give me this solution. 
firstly I make function to get current weather I get the temperature and description through api.
Then I use if-else statement for icon displaying.
I tried to display fiveday weather too I used api for getting 16day weather but I give it count for only five days
var dt = new Date();
dt = dt.setDate(dt.getDate()+0); 
firslt dt gets today's date by Date function Then I just setDtate by adding number to get nextday date To display five day
I make list in html Then I use document.getElementById to put in a list date,min_temp,max_temp

Thank You,
